- Analytics (revenue, orders, ratings, top items, etc.)
- Reviews & ratings
- Coupons & offers (with expiry, validation)
- Notifications
- JWT authentication (admin/restaurant_owner roles)
- Batch/background jobs (coupon expiry, analytics, notifications)
- Indian localization (INR, phone/address, GST, UPI, etc.)

---

## Requirements
- Python 3.10+
- PostgreSQL
- [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) (for process management)

---

## Setup

1. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   cd backend/restaurant
   uv pip install --system --requirements pyproject.toml
   ```

2. **Configure environment:**
   - Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and set your DB/JWT values.
   - Example:
     ```env
     DATABASE_URL=postgresql+asyncpg://unitedkarts:password@localhost:5432/unitedkarts
     JWT_SECRET=supersecretkey
     JWT_ALGORITHM=HS256
     ```

3. **Run migrations:**
   - (Use Alembic or your preferred tool to create DB tables from models.)

4. **Start the service (API + batch jobs):**
   ```bash
   uv start
   ```
   - The API will run on [http://localhost:8001](http://localhost:8001)
   - Batch jobs (coupon expiry, analytics, notifications) run in parallel.

## JWT Authentication
- Obtain a token via `/api/auth/login` (dummy endpoint for testing):
  ```bash
  curl -X POST http://localhost:8001/api/auth/login \
    -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
    -d '{"user_id": "admin1", "role": "admin", "password": "test"}'
  ```
- Use the returned `access_token` as a Bearer token in all write requests:
  ```bash
  curl -H "Authorization: Bearer <token>" ...
  ```
- Only `admin` and `restaurant_owner` roles can create/update/delete.
